# Linear-regression
Linear algebra is essential to machine learning. By identifying relationships of points in vector space, patterns can be determined that can lead to accurate predictions.
In this tutorial, we’ll be calculating a best-fit line and using the equation of that line to model the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In simpler terms, we’ll be finding an equation to represent the correlations present in our dataset.
Linear regression is one of the simplest algorithms used in machine learning, and therefore it’s good to start here.
